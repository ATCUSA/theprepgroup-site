          The Prep Group is a local community focused on preparedness, self-sufficiency, and
          building resilient communities. We share knowledge, resources, and support each other in
          developing skills for sustainable living and emergency preparedness.
        </p>

          Our community brings together individuals with diverse backgrounds and expertise, from
          gardening and food preservation to alternative energy and emergency medical skills.

          Through our Revolt server, we organize discussions, share resources, coordinate meetups,
          and build a stronger local network of prepared individuals and families.
